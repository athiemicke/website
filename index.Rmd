Hello, I am Alexander Thiemicke and I am currently a PhD Candidate at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) in the [Chemical and Physical Biology PhD Program](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/cpb/person/alexander-thiemicke/). I am interested in understanding how cells work.

__How does the environment control cell fate?__

I am interested in understanding how cells sense, integrate and respond to environmental stimulation. During my PhD work I have studied the effect of gradual increases of extracellular stress on cells.
