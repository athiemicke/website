Sometimes I like to do projects and then post them on the internet for the whole world to benefit!
here's some examples. 

## [Protein Network dynamics]

- A shiny app that allows you to explore the dynamics of dozens of proteins in their response to hypertonic stress
- Explore distributions and network connections


## [Nutrition info] 

- Vizualize contents of nutrients of different foods against each other
- Calculate the amount of a nutrient per calorie
