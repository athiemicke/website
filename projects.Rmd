My journey through Data exploration in relation to my PhD project.

## [Gene expression vizualization](https://athiemicke.github.io/website/Project0.html)

- This project extracts data from [Ferreiro et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20187982) in which the authors measured chenges in gene expression of MEF cells in hypertonic stress
- The data is shown as the  log2 fold change relative to untreated cells

## [Gene expression interactive vizualization in shiny]

- A shiny app that allows to query the [Ferreiro et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20187982) Microarray data set on hyperosmotic stress in MEFs
- Explore changes in gene expression by GO terms

## [Natural language processing approach to search for hidden information in the scientific literature]

- In this project I applied methods of natural language processing to the scientific literature
- I am a systems biologist and am interested in behavior of cells in a certain conditions
- This means I am looking at biology in a different angle than biologists do
- In this project I apply this angle and screen throught the fullltext of 1000s of articles that meet specific criteria to unveil hidden results and information

## [Protein Network dynamics](https://athiemicke.shinyapps.io/viz_app/)

- A shiny app that allows you to explore the dynamics of dozens of proteins in their response to hypertonic stress
- Explore distributions and network connections

## [Machine learning applied to Health care datasets]

- A combined dataset of hospice, census and cancer data
- We applied machine learning algorhitms to uncover hidden trends and connections

## [Nutrition info] 

- Vizualize contents of nutrients of different foods against each other
- Calculate the amount of a nutrient per calorie
