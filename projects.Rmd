I was fortunate to have the ooprotunity to learn about data analysis and data science during my PhD. In the following, I illustrate examples of how I use programming to access data and vizualize it.


## [Gene expression vizualization](https://athiemicke.com/Project0.html)

- This project uses data from [Ferreiro et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20187982) in which the authors measured chenges in gene expression of MEF cells in hypertonic stress
- The datasets provides an insight into changes in gene expression in mammalian cells over time. 

## [Natural language processing approach to search for hidden information in the scientific literature](https://athiemicke.com/Project1.html)

- In this project I applied methods of natural language processing to the scientific literature
- I am a systems biologist and am interested in behavior of cells in certain conditions
- This means I am looking at biology in a different angle than most biologists do
- In this project I apply this angle and screen throught the fullltext of 1000s of articles that meet specific criteria to unveil hidden results and information

## [Protein Network dynamics](https://athiemicke.com/Project2.html)

- A shiny app that allows you to explore the dynamics of dozens of proteins in their response to hypertonic stress
- Explore distributions and network connections

## [Machine learning applied to Health care datasets](https://athiemicke.com/Project3.html)

- A combined dataset of hospice, census and cancer data
- We applied machine learning algorhitms to uncover hidden trends and connections

## [Nutrition info](https://athiemicke.com/Project4.html)

- Vizualize contents of nutrients of different foods against each other
- Calculate the amount of a nutrient per calorie
